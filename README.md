# Bias-Variance-Tradeoff-Analysis
This project analyzes the bias-variance tradeoff in polynomial regression models. It explores how model complexity impacts bias, variance, and total error. The project generates multiple noisy datasets and fits polynomial models of degree 1, 3, and 5, visualizing the errors and demonstrating the tradeoff between bias and variance.
